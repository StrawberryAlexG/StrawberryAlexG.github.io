<div id="h2" style="margin-top:30px;"> About Me</div>

<div id="para" style="margin-top:10px;"> Hello, my name is Alejandra (Alex) Giron (she/her), I am 22 years old,
I am from Virginia, and I have one sister. In my free time I love to listen to music, create, play video games,
and watch different shows and movies. I really enjoy sketching and planning future projects, centered around arts and crafts.
I have recently been reading poetry books and comics, which I have been really enjoying, more specifically I have found illustrated poetry 
books, which have inspired me greatly. For my future career, I hope to work in publishing, continuing my journey with illustration, comics,
publishing, and artist books. <br><br>

<div id="h2" style= "margin-top:30px;"> Artwork: Mediums and Themes</div>

<div id="para" style="margin-top:10px;"> With my artwork I like to work themes such as: <i>nature</i>, <i>surrealism</i>, <i>mythology</i>, and <i>trauma</i>.
I like to work with themes I am passionate about and can go deep with the research. I am a huge fan of surrealism and 
work with it a lot in my artwork. For my senior project I have combined surrealism with personal experience in my life
and want to continue to explore that combination of themes in future projects. I especially enjoy comics, illustration and book arts.
I am continuously trying to find ways to push these mediums and shape them beyond their limits in art. In my practice, I continue
to explore more art mediums and themes, exploring new mediums and putting them in my artwork, is something I plan to keep doing
to grow my practice in art for the future.</div>

<div id="para" style="margin-top:10px;"> Mediums and art forms I enjoy working with include: book arts, illustration, paper craft, and painting.
For illustration I enjoy working with inking pens, colored pencils, and markers. My experience with painting includes
watercolor and acrylics. My favorite material to work with is paper, because of its versatility and it is also a material I use the
most when it comes to my artwork and practice. I have experience with Cricut cutting machines and materials, as well as digital art through
a tablet. I also experiment with materials, mixing mediums, which involves sewing/stitching, fabrics, jewelry making, and beading.</div>
